# Product-Detection-for-retail

   FMCG(Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) brands require insights into retail shelves to help them improve their sales. One such insight comes from determining how many products of their brands’ are present versus how many products of competing brands are present on a retail store shelf.This requires finding the total number of products present on every shelf in a retail store
